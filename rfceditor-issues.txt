1) <!-- [rfced] Please insert any keywords (beyond those that appear in the title) for use on https://www.rfc-editor.org/search. 

ACTION: added keywords

2) <!--[rfced] Should "C1-C5" perhaps be "C1-C6" in this sentence?

Current:
   The considerations (C1-C5) presented in this document
   are backed by peer-reviewed research, which used 
   wide-scale Internet measurements to draw their 
   conclusions. 
-->

ACTION: Agreed and changed

3) <!-- [rfced] Does "in one city or region" refer to "domains" (Perhaps A) or "users" (Perhaps B)? Also, please clarify "less required"; does this perhaps mean "not as necessary"?

Original:
   These considerations may not be appropriate for smaller domains, such as
   those used by an organization with users in one unicast network, or in one
   city or region, where operational goals such as uniform, global low latency
   are less required.
   
Perhaps A:
   These considerations may not be appropriate for smaller domains, such as
   those used by an organization with users in one unicast network or those in
   a single city or region, where operational goals such as uniform, global
   low latency are not as necessary.

Perhaps B:

   those used by an organization with users in one unicast network or in
   a single city or region, where operational goals such as uniform, global
   low latency are not as necessary.
-->

ACTION: B is correct and replaced below

4) <!-- [rfced] Should "disusing" be "discussing"?

Original:
   Because the conclusions of the reviewed studies don't measure smaller
   networks, the wording in this document concentrates solely on disusing
   large-scale DNS authoritative services only.
   
Perhaps:
   Because the conclusions of the reviewed studies don't measure smaller
   networks, the wording in this document concentrates solely on discussing
   large-scale DNS authoritative services.

ACTION: agreed, discussing is better.  Technically, it could be
dropped to if you'd prefer that.

-->


5)  <!--[rfced] We made the following text into an ordered list. Please
let us know of any concerns or if any further updates are desired.

Original:
   Replication at the
   authoritative server level can be achieved with (i) the deployment of
   multiple servers for the same zone [RFC1035] (AT1-AT4 in Figure 1),
   (ii) the use of IP anycast [RFC1546][RFC4786][RFC7094] that allows
   the same IP address to be announced from multiple locations (each of
   referred to as an "anycast instance" [RFC8499]) and (iii) the use of
   load balancers to support multiple servers inside a single
   (potentially anycasted) instance. 

Current:
   Replication at the authoritative server level can be achieved with 
   the following:

   i.    the deployment of multiple servers for the same zone [RFC1035]
         (AT1-AT4 in Figure 1);

   ii.   the use of IP anycast [RFC1546] [RFC4786] [RFC7094] that allows
         the same IP address to be announced from multiple locations
         (each of referred to as an "anycast instance" [RFC8499]); and

   iii.  the use of load balancers to support multiple servers inside a
         single (potentially anycasted) instance.  As a consequence,
         there are many possible ways an authoritative DNS provider can
         engineer its production authoritative server network with
         multiple viable choices, and there is not necessarily a single
         optimal design.

ACTION: looks good, leaving as is.  Thank you.

-->     


6) <!-- [rfced] Should the section titles be updated for parallel construction?

Original:
   C1: Deploy anycast in every authoritative server to enhance distribution
   and latency
   C2: Optimizing routing is more important than location count and diversity
   C3: Collecting anycast catchment maps to improve design
   C4: When under stress, employ two strategies
   C5: Consider longer time-to-live values whenever possible
   C6: Consider the TTL differences between parents and children
   
Perhaps:
   C1: Deploying Anycast in Every Authoritative Server to Enhance Distribution
       and Latency
   C2: Optimizing Routing More Important than Location Count and Diversity
   C3: Collecting Anycast Catchment Maps to Improve Design
   C4: Employing Two Strategies When under Stress 
   C5: Considering Longer TTL Values Whenever Possible
   C6: Considering the TTL Differences between Parents and Children

ACTION: C1 should be "deploy" as it's a recommendation/consideration
that supposed to be an "action" to take.  In fact, I changed C3 to be
"Collect" instead.  And C4: Employ Two Strategies When under Stress.
And C6: Consider the Difference in Parent and Children's TTL values.

8) <!-- [rfced] May we update "from using BGP" to "when using BGP" for clarity?

Original:
   Selecting where and how many global locations 
   to announce from using BGP is tricky.

Perhaps:
   Selecting where and how many global locations 
   to announce when using BGP is tricky.

ACTION: No, that doesn't work.  The sentence is describing what
physical points should be sending announcements (hence the "from").
Does this rephrasing work better:?

   Selecting the right quantity and set of global locations 
   that should send BGP announcements is tricky.

[I did not do a replacement]

9) <!-- [rfced] Would "more instances are better" be an accurate
rephrasing of "the more instances the better"?

Original:
   Intuitively, one could naively think that the more instances the
   better and simply "more" will always lead to shorter response times.

Perhaps:

10) <!--[rfced] Is the overall performance of the DNS Root servers being

Original:

   DNS Root servers. 

Perhaps:
   To measure the overall performance of four DNS Root servers, 
   they analyzed the relationship between the number of
   anycast instances and service performance (i.e., latency of
   the round-trip time (RTT)).

ACTION: agreed that is awkward as is -- here's a proposed replacement
that I think is more clear:

  To study the relationship between the number of anycast instances
  and the associated service performance, they measured the round-trip
  time (RTT) latency of four DNS root servers.

  a service's nearest distributed anycast locations measured by the
  number of routing hops.

13) <!--[rfced] Please clarify if the intended meaning is based on
"changing anycast service changes" or "changing anycast services".

18) <!-- [rfced] We rephrased this sentence slightly to improve
readability; please let us know of any concerns.

Original:

Current:
   Time-to-live (TTL) values [RFC1034][RFC1035] for DNS records directly

Perhaps:
   Some early work modeled caches as a function of their TTLs [Jung03a],
   and recent work has examined cache interactions with DNS [Moura18b]...

ACTION: that works, yes.  Thanks.

20) <!-- [rfced] Should "8, 12, or 24 hours" be "4, 8, or 24 hours" per
