Ed note

I'm assuming that none of this text is intende to remain in the
published RFC, so it would be good to remove it all now. Thaat means
addressing and removing all the [] notes in the text.

Expand abreviations on first use.

I see:
TLD
RTT (although this is expanded incorrectly as 'route-trip time' in
     Section 6)
DDoS
CDN

I think you can get away with DNS although I see you do expand it at
the start of Section 2. If you want to retain the expansion, you should
move it to the first use of 'DNS'.

Section 1 has...

   It is likely that these considerations might be useful in a wider
   context, such as for any stateless/short-duration, anycasted service

I wonder whether that should be in the Abstract as well. Else it will
probably never be picked up by people who might benefit from it.

In the Abstract you could say:

   It is possible that the considerations presented in this document
   could be applicable in a wider context, such as for any stateless/
   short-duration, anycasted service.

Some of the section titles for Sections 3-7 are a bit long. There is
no requirement that they are restricted to one line, but there is a sort
of convention. And, frankly, it looks better and is easier to read.

Have a think about that and see if you want to make any changes.

The naming of DNS roots (C, F, K, and L in Section 4) is obvious to
those from the DNS world, but will be a mystery to other readers. Maybe
this needs a little extra text such as...

   There are currently 17 DNS Root servers, identified by the letters A
   through L.

Section 5

   Adding new instances to an anycast service may change the load
   distribution across all instances, leading to suboptimal usage of the
   service or even stressing some instances while others remain
   underutilized.

It is not obvious to this reader how adding an instance can add stress
to other instances. I can see that adding an instance could result in
other instances being under-utilized, and I can see how adding an
instance could immediately result in that new instance being stressed.

Section 5 introduces Verfploeter, but notes that it plots for IPv4.
Shouldn't you at least have a ocmment about IPv6 in this context?

 * TODO

Section 6 has:

   an area currently under study

By whom? Any reference you can add?

"Currently" will age poorly in the published document. Maybe "at the
time of publication of this document".

I was surprised that Section 7 doesn't discuss cache size and the
behavior when a cache is full. These fetaures surely interact very
strongly with TTLs and can cause all sorts of "unexpected" results.

Section 7, bullet

   o Shorter caching can with DNS-based load balancing:

I can't parse a meaning from this. Suspect missing words.

Section 8 has...

   This document suggests the use of [I-D.ietf-dnsop-serve-stale].
   
    * fixed

Up to this point, it hasn't suggested that. Security sections usually
either summarize the considerations from the rest of the document or
introduce concepts with a little more structure.

Section 9

Well, yes, hmmm. It's true what you say, but isn't it a fact that DNS is
a big concern for very many people when looking at privacy?

Isn't it possible to at least point up future research concerning
privacy. For example, caching means that requests don't go further
afield and that may help with some forms of aggregate privacy.
