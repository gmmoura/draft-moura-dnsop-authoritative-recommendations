That's a good suggestion and I'll drop Bill a note.

That should be easy enough for you to address.

Easy edits.

Should be pretty simple to achieve.

Easy

That might be a bit more work, but it sounds like a good idea.

Just needs a sentence.

Not sure about this comment. Have a think about it and make some changes
or let me know why not.

Anything you can add?

Should be something you can add quite easily.

I'm not too worried about this. If you have more citations to add, go for
it. Otherwise, don't bother.

I think Wes had promised to have a go at this. Any progress?

Oh, yes. Please fix this.
