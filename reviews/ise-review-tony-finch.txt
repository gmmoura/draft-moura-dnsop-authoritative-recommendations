That's a good suggestion and I'll drop Bill a note.

That should be easy enough for you to address.

## DONE: added links to those two

Easy edits.

## DONE

Should be pretty simple to achieve.

## DONE
   (requires putting a lot of stuff in bullets or sub-sections, which
   is a good thing to do but will take work -- maybe "background" and
   "recommendation" subsections to each C*?)

   DONE: made subsections with background and considerations separated

Easy

## DONE: changed section 3 title

> actionable, e.g. "DNS operators should also take architectural

> what architectural considerations?

That might be a bit more work, but it sounds like a good idea.

## DONE in rewrite of subsections

Should be simple

## DONE: changed the title to talk about optimization

> I like that section 5 points at a practical tool.

:-)

Just needs a sentence.

## DONE: sentence added: Operators should be able to deploy one or
both of these strategies rapidly.

Not sure about this comment. Have a think about it and make some changes
or let me know why not.

## NOT DONE - that paper is missing

* note -- that paper is missing, might be this one? - unsure
    https://vdocuments.us/dns-performance-and-the-effectiveness-of-caching-badri552dirpapersdnsdnscaching02pdf.html

Anything you can add?

## DNOE: added ref to cache me if you can



> How do the considerations for negative TTLs differ?

Should be something you can add quite easily.

## DONE: fortunately, a new paper actually addresses this so I've
   added it.

I'm not too worried about this. If you have more citations to add, go for
it. Otherwise, don't bother.

## DONE - the papers individually have references, and I don't think
   we want to duplicate them all in our draft.

> There are a bunch of spelling / grammar problems which I assume will
> be cleared up during copyediting

I think Wes had promised to have a go at this. Any progress?

## DONE - heavy rewriting

Oh, yes. Please fix this.

## DONE: fixed
