#  Independent Draft

   * We will submit this as an independent draft after presentation at DNSOP during IETF105
   * This document describes the steps required, as specified by the independent submission process


## 1. Preparation (requirements from RFC editor)
   * See background (2.1). We need to send an email to the RFC editor with the following points:

   * a)  The file name of the published Internet-Draft that is being submitted.
      * draft-moura-dnsop-authoritative-recommendations
   * b) The desired category (Informational or Experimental) of the RFC:  
      * Informational
   * c) A summary of related discussion of this document, if any, that has occurred in an IETF  working group or in the IESG.

This document describes a set of considerations for large authoritative DNS server operators.
All these considerations are based on peer-reviewed academic papers that employed large scale Internet measurements. Each consideration has been deployed as well, by at least one operator.

We first brought this document to DNSOP, first presented during IETF104, and then at IETF105.
We have documented in [0] all emails threads from DNSOP  and slides, presentations as well.

Summary of the discussions:  we first presented it at DNSOP during IETF104, and we have received feedback from various IETFers, which we incorporated and produced a new version and presented at IETF105.  We broke down the feedback into issues tracked on Github[1].

A few important fixes from this process:  During IETF104, it was pointed that the original word 'recommendation' should be replaced by 'consideration', given that recommendation may reduce authoritative servers setup heterogeneity.
Also, from another recommendation was that R5 (on -03, and renamed to C5 on -04) was too broad. To address this, we have completely rewrote it, based on a new measurement study we have just been accepted for publication (peer reviewed, IMC2019)

After fixing all these issues, we presented it at DNSOP during IETF105, and the chairs  asked the room to hum to have a sense if they want the draft to be adopted. There was no consensus on it, maybe 60% in favor, 40% against.  A follow-on comment after the hum from an attendee: it's hard for DNSOP to improve this document, given its derived from academic paper which have been published, and the WG cannot change the findings. Our feeling is that the DNSOP members did not oppose the considerations themselves, but don't support adoption since it's functionally a report of other work that DNSOP can't easily contribute to.  We spoke with Suzanne Woolf (a DNSOP chair), and she agrees with this assessment and supports our plan to submit this through the independent submission process instead.

Overall, we'r happy to have taken the document to DNSOP and appreciate the feedback obtained and allowed us to improve the document.

 * d) An assertion that no IANA allocation in the document requires IETF Consensus or Standards Action; see RFC 5226 for more information.

```This document has no IANA considerations given it is purely information and proposes no protocol changes```

## 2. Background

### 2.1 Requirements from RFC editor:
   ```
       https://www.rfc-editor.org/about/independent/

   For an independent submission, the author should send an email message to the Independent Submissions Editor: rfc-ise@rfc-editor.org. This message should include the following information:

       * The file name of the published Internet-Draft that is being submitted.

       * The desired category (Informational or Experimental) of the RFC.

       * A summary of related discussion of this document, if any, that has occurred in an IETF  working group or in the IESG.

       * An assertion that no IANA allocation in the document requires IETF Consensus or Standards Action; see RFC 5226 for more information. (In either case, the document cannot be published independently; it should instead be sent to the IESG).
       Optionally, a statement of the purpose of publishing this document, its intended audience, its merits and significance.

       * Optionally, suggested names and contact information for one or more competent and independent potential reviewers for the document. This can speed the review and approval process.
   ```

   ### 2.2 RFC on Independent Drafts

      * https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4846
      * Why our draft is good for it:
      * Section 2: `The Role of Independent Submissions``
          * ``Introduction of important new ideas as a bridge publication venue
         between academia and IETF engineering.``
