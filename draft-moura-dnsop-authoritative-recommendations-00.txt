1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS) has main two types of "DNS servers":
   authoritative servers and resolvers.  Figure 1 shows their
   relationship.  An authoritative server is "a server that knows the
   content of a DNS zone from local knowledge, and thus can answer
   queries about that zone needing to query other servers" [RFC2182].  A
   resolver, in turn, is "a program "that extract(s) information from
   name servers in response to client requests" [RFC1034].  A client, in
   Figure 1, is shown as "stub", which is a stub resolver [RFC1034] that
   is located on the client side.

        Figure 1: Relationship between recursive resolvers (R) and
                      authoritative name servers (AT)

   DNS queries can contribute to web latency and affect user experience
   [Sigla2014], and the DNS system has been subject to repeated Denial-
   of-Service (DoS) attacks (for example, in November 2015 [Moura16b]).
   To reduce latency and improve resiliency against DoS attacks, DNS
   uses several types of server replication.  Replication can be
   achieved with the deployment of multiple authoritative servers for
   the same zone [RFC1035] (AT1--AT4 in Figure 1), IP anycast
   [RFC1546][RFC7094] and and with load balancers supporting multiple
   servers inside a single anycast site.  As a consequence, there are
   many possible ways a DNS provider could engineer its authoritative
   servers, with multiple viable choices and no single optimal design.

   This document summarizes recent research work exploring DNS
   configurations in specific tangible recommendations for authoritative
   servers operators (DNS operators hereafter).  It presents
   recommendations from studies with the goal of improving DNS
   engineering, to understand how anycast reacts to DoS
   attacks[Moura16b], how anycast affects query latency[Schmidt17a],
   accurately mapping anycast [Vries17b], how recursive and
   authoritative resolvers interact[Mueller17b], and how recursive
   resolvers caching and retries help clients during DDoS attacks on
   authoritatives[Moura18b].  The recommendations (R1-R6) presented in
   this document are backed by these studies that used wide-scale
   Internet measurements.  This document describes the key engineering
   options, and points readers to the pertinent papers for details.

2.  R1: all authoritative server should have similar latency

   Authoritative DNS servers operators, such as Top-level domain (TLD)
   operators (e.g.,: .org and .nl) announce their authoritative servers
   in the form of NS records.  Different authoritatives return the same
   content typically using DNS zone transfers to share a master copy.

   DNS heavily relies upon replication to support high reliability and
   capacity and to reduce latency [Moura16b].  DNS has two complementary
   mechanisms to replicate service.  First, the protocol itself supports
   nameserver replication of DNS service for a DNS zone where multiple
   servers operate on different IP addresses, listed by that zone's NS
   records.  Second, each of these servers can run from multiple
   physical locations with IP anycast, by announcing the same IP address
   from each and allowing Internet routing (BGP) to associate clients
   with each anycast site.  Outside the protocol, replication can be
   achieved by deployed load balancers in which anycast site location.
   Nameserver replication is recommended for all zones, and IP anycast
   is used by most large zones such as the DNS Root and most top-level
   domains[Moura16b].

   DNS operators strive to reduce latency for users of their service.
   However, because they control only their authoritative servers, and
   not the recursive resolvers using those servers, it is difficult to
   insure that recursives will be served by the closest authoritative
   server.  Server selection is up to the software in the recursive
   resolvers, and different vendors and releases employ different
   criteria when choosing authoritatives.

   Knowing how recursives choose authoritative servers is a key step to
   better engineer the deployment of authoritative servers.
   [Mueller17b] evaluates this with measurement study in which they
   deployed seven unicast authoritative name servers in different global
   locations and queried these authoritative servers from more than
   9,000 RIPE Atlas probes (Vantage Points--VPs) and their respective
   recursive resolvers.

   In the wild, [Mueller17b] found that recursives query all available
   authoritative servers, regardless of latency.  But the distribution
   of queries tend to be skewed towards authoritatives with lower
   latency: the lower the latency between authoritative and recursive,
   the more often the recursive will send queries to this authoritative.
   Our hypothesis is that this behavior is a consequence of two main
   criteria employed by resolvers when choosing authoritatives:
   performance (lower latency) and diversity of authoritatives, where a
   resolver checks all recursives to determine which is closer and to
   provide alternatives if one is unavailable.

Internet-Draft          Recomm-Authoritative-Ops           November 2018


   For a DNS operator, this policy means that latency of all
   authoritatives matter, so all must be similarly capable, since all
   available authoritatives will be queried by most recursives.  Since
   unicast cannot deliver good latency worldwide (a site in Europe will
   always have a high latency to resolvers in California, for example),
   [Mueller17b] recommends DNS operators to deploy equally strong IP
   anycast in every authoritative server (thus phase out unicast), so
   they can deliver similar latency values to recursives.  Having one or
   few unicast authoritative will limit the worst-case latency for most
   users.  Note that DNS operators should take also architectural
   considerations into account when planning for deploying anycast
   [RFC1546].

   This recommendation was deployed on .nl, which used to have a mixed
   unicast/anycast setup, and since early 2018 has 4 anycast
   authoritative name servers.

3.  R2: Routing Can Matter More Than Locations

   A common metric when choosing an anycast DNS provider or setting up
   an anycast service is the number of anycast sites, i.e., the number
   of global locations from which the same address is announced with
   BGP.  Intuitively, one could think that more sites would lead to
   shorter response times.

   However, this is not necessarily true.  In fact, [Schmidt17a] found
   that routing can matter more than the total number of locations.
   They analyzed the relationship between the number of anycast sites
   and performance of a service (latency-wise, RTT) and measured the
   overall performance of four DNS Root servers, namely C, F, K and L,
   from more than 7.9K RIPE Atlas probes.

   [Schmidt17a] found that the C-Root, a smaller anycast deployment with
   8 sites, provided a very similar overall performance than that of the
   much larger deployments of K and L, with 33 and 144 sites
   respectively.  We observed a median RTT between 30ms and 32ms for C,
   K and L roots, and 25ms for F.

   Their recommendation for DNS operators when engineering anycast
   services is to not only consider the number of sites as a metric for
   performance.. They showed that 12 sites can provide reasonable
   latency, given they are globally distributed and have good local
   interconnectivity.  However, more sites can be useful in handling DoS
   attacks [Mueller17b].

4.  R3: Detailed Anycast Maps of Catchments Requires Active Measurement

   An anycast service may have several dozens sites, as L-Root.  Anycast
   leverages BGP to distribute the incoming queries to anycast sites; in
   theory, BGP forwards incoming queries to a nearby anycast site (in
   terms of BGP distance).  However, usually queries are not evenly
   distributed across anycast sites, as in the case of L-Root
   [IcannHedge18].

   Adding new sites to an anycast service may change the load
   distribution across all sites, leading to suboptimal usage of the
   service or even stressing some sites while others remain
   underutilized.  This is a scenario that operators constantly face
   when expanding an anycast service.  Besides, when setting up a new
   anycast server, operators cannot directly estimate the query
   distribution among the sites.

   To estimate the query loads across sites of an expanding service or a
   setting up a new service, operators need detailed anycast maps, i.e.,
   to know which prefixes will be matched to each anycast site.  To do
   that, [Vries17b] recommends operators carrying out active
   measurements, using a technique and tool we have developed called
   Verfploeter.  Verfploeter maps the entire IPv4 space and allows DNS
   operators to predict both query distribution and clients catchment
   before deploying new anycast sites.

   [Vries17b] have used this technique to predict both the catchment and
   query load distribution for the new anycast service of B-Root.
   First, they set up two anycast sites Miami (MIA) and Los Angeles
   (LAX) which were exact copies of those sites from the operational
   B-Root server.  Next, they sent ICMP packets to multiple IPs from
   each /24 in on the Internet, and used an IP within the anycast range
   as the source of these ICMP packets.  Then, they observed to which
   site BGP mapped the ICMP echo replies, generating a catchment map.
   They then weighted the incoming traffic of 1 day of B-Root traffic
   (2017-04-12, DITL datasets [Ditl17]) using this catchment mapping,
   and estimated that 81.6% of the traffic would go to the LAX site.
   The actual value was 81.4% of traffic going to LAX, which means that
   the estimation was pretty close.

   Besides that, Verfploeter can be used to estimate how traffic shifts
   among sites in case some of BGP manipulations are executed, such as
   AS Path prepending also used during DDoS attacks.  We created a new
   catchment mapping for each configuration: no prepending, and
   prepeding with 1, 2 or 3 hops.  Then, [Vries17b] used this mappings
   to estimate the load distribution for each configuration.

Internet-Draft          Recomm-Authoritative-Ops           November 2018


   Therefore, [Vries17b] recommendation for DNS operators is to make
   informed choices when engineering new anycast sites or expand current
   ones by using catchment maps with active measurements carried out
   with Verfploeter.  Besides, operators can spot suboptimal routing
   situations early, with a fine granularity, and with better coverage
   than using traditional measurement platforms such as Ripe Atlas.

5.  R4: When under stress, two strategies

   DDoS attacks are becoming bigger, cheaper, and more frequent
   [Mueller17b].  The most powerful recorded DDoS attack to DNS servers
   to date reached 1.2 Tbps, by using IoT devices [Perlroth16].  Such
   attacks call for an answer for the following question: how should a
   DNS operator engineer its anycast authoritative DNS server react to
   the stress of a DDoS attack?  We have investigated this question in
   study [Moura16b] in which they ground empirical observations with the
   following theoretical evaluation of options.

   An authoritative DNS server deployed using anycast will have many
   sites distributed over many networks.  Ultimately, the relationship
   between the DNS provider network and a client's ISP will determine
   which anycast site will answer for queries for a given client.  As a
   consequence, when an anycast authoritative server is under attack,
   the load that each anycast site receives is likely to be unevenly
   distributed (a function of the source of the attacks), thus some
   sites may be more overloaded than others which is what was observed
   analyzing the Root DNS events of Nov. 2015 [Moura16b].  Given the
   fact that different sites may have different capacity (bandwidth,
   CPU, etc.), the choice of how to react to stress becomes even more
   difficult.

   In practice, an anycast site under stress, overloaded with incoming
   traffic, has two options:

   o  It can withdraw/prepend route to some or to all of its neighbors,
      shrinking its catchment (number of clients that BGP maps to it)
      and shifting both legitimate and attack traffic to other anycast
      sites.  Possibly those sites will have greater capacity and
      service the queries.

   o  Alternatively, it can be become a degraded absorber, continuing to
      operate, but with overloaded ingress routers, dropping some
      incoming legitimate requests due to queue overflow.  However,
      continued operation will also absorb traffic from attackers in its
      catchment, protecting other anycast sites.

   [Moura16b] saw both of these behaviors in practice in the Root DNS
   events and observe them through site reachability and RTTs.  These



Moura, et al.             Expires May 10, 2019                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          Recomm-Authoritative-Ops           November 2018


   options represent different uses of an anycast deployment.  A
   withdrawal strategy causes anycast to respond as a waterbed, with
   stress displacing queries from one site to others.  The absorption
   strategy behaves as a conventional mattress, compressing under load,
   with queries getting delayed or dropped.

   Although described as strategies and policies, these outcomes are the
   result of several factors: the combination of operator and host ISP
   routing policy, routing implementations withdrawing under load, the
   nature of the attack, and the locations of the sites and attackers.
   Some policies are explicit, such as the choice of local-only anycast
   sites, or operators removing a site for maintenance or modifying
   routing to manage load.  However, under stress, the choices of
   withdrawal and absorption can also be results that emerge from a mix
   of explicit choices and implementation details, such as BGP timeout
   values.

   [Moura16b] speculates that more careful, explicit, and automated
   management of policies may provide stronger defenses to overload, an
   area we are currently working on.  For DNS operators, that means that
   besides traditional filtering, two other options are available
   (withdraw/prepend or isolate sites), and the best choice depends on
   the specifics of the attack.

6.  R5: Be careful on how to choose your records time-to-live values

   In a DNS response, each resource record is accompanied by a time-to-
   live value, which "describes how long a RR can be cached before it
   should be discarded" [RFC1034].  The TTL values are set by
   authoritative DNS server operators at their zone files - either
   specifically per record or as default values for the entire zone.
   Sometimes the same research record may have different TTL values -
   one from the parent and one from the child DNS server.  In this
   cases, resolvers are expected to prioritize the answer according to
   Section 5.4.1 in [RFC2182].

   While set by authoritative server operators (ATs in Figure 1), the
   TTL value in fact influences the behavior of recursive resolvers (and
   their operators - Rn in the same figure), by setting an upper limit
   on how long a record should be cached before discarded.  In this
   sense, caching can be seen as a sort of "ephemeral replication",
   i.e., the contents of an authoritative server are placed at a
   recursive resolver cache for a period of time up to the TTL value.
   Caching improves response times (by avoiding repeated queries between
   recursive resolvers and authoritative).

   Besides improving performance, caching may play a significant role
   during DoS attacks against authoritative servers.  To investigate



Moura, et al.             Expires May 10, 2019                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          Recomm-Authoritative-Ops           November 2018


   that, we carried out a study [Moura18b] that evaluates the role of
   caching (and retries) in DNS resiliency to DDoS attacks.  We
   configured two authoritative name servers for our newly registered
   domain and carried out a series of experiments with various TTL
   values (60,1800, 3600, 86400s) for records and sent unique DNS
   queries from roughly 15,000 vantage points, using Ripe Atlas.

   We found that caching, in the wild, works as expected 70% of the
   times - for various TTL values we found.  We believe that complex
   recursive infrastructure (such as anycast recursives with fragmented
   cache), besides cache flushing and hierarchy explains these other 30%
   of non cached records.  We confirmed the results from our experiments
   by analyzing authoritative traffic for the .nl TLD, which showed
   similar figures.

   We then set out to emulate DDoS attacks on authoritative servers by
   dropping all incoming pakcets for various TTLs values.  We found
   that:

   o  At 100% of packets dropped, the TTL value of the record set by the
      authoritative determined how long clients received responses,
      together with the status of the cache at the attack time.  Given
      the TTL value decreases as time passes at the cache, it protected
      clients for up to its value in cache.

   o  Once TTL values expire, we also saw evidence of some recursives
      serving stale content [I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-bis].  Serve
      stale was the only option when TTL values expire in recursives
      cache and authoritative servers were completely unavailable.

   We also emulated partial-failure DDoS (similar to Dyn 2016
   [Perlroth16]), when authoritative are partially available, by
   dropping packet at rates of 50-90%, for various TTL values.  We found
   that:

   o  For various TTL values, caching was a key component in the success
      of queries.  For example, for a 50% packet drop rate at the
      authoritatives, still most of clients got an answer.

   o  When caching could not help (for a scenario with TTL of 60s, and
      time in between probing of 10minutes), recursive servers kept on
      retrying queries to authoritatives: at 90% packet drop with TTL of
      60s, we found that 27% of clients still got an answer, at the
      price of increased response times.

   o  We also found that these retries have a significant effect on the
      authoriative side: we saw a 8.1x times increase in normal traffic




Moura, et al.             Expires May 10, 2019                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft          Recomm-Authoritative-Ops           November 2018


      during a 90% packet drop with TTL of 60s, as recursives attempt to
      resolve queries - what we refer to "friendly fire".

   Therefore, given the role of TTL, our recommendation for DNS
   operators is to set their TTL values carefully, knowing that they
   will influence (i) the success of client's queries and (ii) the
   amount of "friendly fire" traffic they will receive.  Many operators
   may as well reconsider their 10x overprovision metric for DNS
   servers, given this significant increase legitimate traffic during
   DDoS.

7.  R6: Shared Infrastructure Risks Collateral Damage During Attacks

   Co-locating services, such as authoritative servers, creates some
   degree of shared risk, in that stress on one service may spill over
   into another, resulting in collateral damage.  Collateral damage is a
   common side-effect of DDoS, and data centers and operators strive to
   minimize collateral damage through redundancy, overcapacity, and
   isolation.

   We have also seen this in practice during the DDoS attack against the
   Root DNS system in November 2015 [Moura16b].  In this study, we found
   that two services not directly targeted by the attack, namely D-Root
   and the .nl TLD, suffered collateral damage.  These services showed
   reduced end-to-end performance (i.e., higher latency and reduced
   reachability) with timing consistent with the DDoS event, strongly
   suggesting a shared resource with original targets of the attack.

   Another example of collateral damage was the 1.2 Tbps attack against
   Dyn, a major DNS provider on October 2017 [Perlroth16].  As a result,
   many of their customers, including Airbnb, HBO, Netflix, and Twitter
   experience issues in resolving their domains, since they partially
   shared the same infrastructure.

   Our recommendation, therefore, is when choosing third-party DNS
   providers, operators should be aware of shared infrastructure risks.
   By sharing infrastructure, there is an increased attack surface.

10.  Summary

   DNS operators strive to deliver both high-performance and resilient
   services.  However, a DNS operators controls only part of the
   infrastructure involved in the name resolution process, which makes
   their task more challenging.  Moreover, the rise of terabit-scale
   IoT-based DDoS attacks against authoritative servers has only made
   the problem worse.

   We have presented in this paper six tangible recommendation obtained
   from various measurements studies we have carried over the last
   years.
