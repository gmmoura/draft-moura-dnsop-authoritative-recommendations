<t>The Domain Name System (DNS) has main two types of "DNS servers": authoritative servers and recursive resolvers. <xref target="recuath"/> shows their relationship. An authoritative server is "a server that knows the content of a DNS zone from local knowledge, and thus can answer queries about that zone  needing to query other servers" <xref target="RFC2182"/>. A recursive resolver, in turn, is "a program "that extract(s) information from name servers in response to client requests" <xref target="RFC1034"/>. A client, in <xref target="recuath"/>, is shown as  "stub", which is shorthand for a "stub resolver" <xref target="RFC1034"/> that is typically located within the client software.</t>

<t>DNS queries contribute to web latency and affect user experience <xref target="Sigla2014"/>, and the DNS system has been subject to repeated Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks (for example, in November 2015 <xref target="Moura16b"/>) in order to degrade user experience. To reduce latency and improve resiliency against DoS attacks, DNS uses several types of server replication. Replication at the authoritative server level can be achieved with the deployment of multiple servers for the same zone <xref target="RFC1035"/> (AT1&#8212;AT4 in <xref target="recuath"/>), the use of IP anycast <xref target="RFC1546"/><xref target="RFC7094"/> and by using load balancers to support multiple servers inside a single (potentially anycasted) site. As a consequence, there are many possible ways a DNS provider can engineer its production authoritative server network, with multiple viable choices and no single optimal design.</t>

<t>This document summarizes recent research work exploring DNS configurations and offers specific tangible recommendations to DNS authoritative servers operators (DNS operators hereafter). It presents recommendations derived from multiple studies with the goal of improving DNS engineering, to promote understanding about how anycast reacts to DoS attacks<xref target="Moura16b"/>, how anycast affects query latency<xref target="Schmidt17a"/>, how to accurately map anycast network reanch <xref target="Vries17b"/>, how recursive and authoritative resolvers interact<xref target="Mueller17b"/>, and how recursive resolver caching and retries help clients during DDoS attacks on authoritatives<xref target="Moura18b"/>. The recommendations (R1&#8211;R6) presented in this document are backed by these studies, which used wide-scale Internet measurements upon which to draw their conclusions. This document describes the key engineering options, and points readers to the pertinent papers for details.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="r1-all-authoritative-server-should-have-similar-latency" title="R1: All authoritative server should have similar latency">

<t>Authoritative DNS servers operators, such as Top-level domain (TLD) operators (e.g.,: .org and .nl), announce their authoritative servers in the form of Name Server (NS) records. Different authoritatives should return the same content, typically by staying synchronized using DNS zone transfers (AXFR<xref target="RFC5936"/> and IXFR<xref target="RFC1995"/>) to coordinate the authoritative zone data to return to their clients.</t>

<t>DNS heavily relies upon replication to support high reliability,
capacity and to reduce latency <xref target="Moura16b"/>. DNS has two complementary mechanisms to replicate the service. First, the protocol itself supports nameserver replication of DNS service for
a DNS zone through the use of multiple nameservers that each operate on different IP addresses, listed by a zone's NS records. Second, each of these network addresses can run from multiple physical locations through the use of
IP anycast<xref target="RFC1546"/>, by announcing the same IP address from each site and allowing Internet routing
(BGP<xref target="RFC4271"/>) to associate clients with their topologically nearest anycast site. Outside the DNS protocol, replication can be achieved by deploying load balancers at each physical location.  Nameserver replication is recommended for all zones, and IP anycast is used by most large zones such as the DNS Root, most top-level domains<xref target="Moura16b"/> and large commercial enterprises, governments and other organizations.</t>

<t>Most DNS operators strive to reduce latency for users of their service.
However, because they control only their authoritative servers,
  and not the recursive resolvers communicating with those servers,
  it is difficult to ensure that recursives will be served by the closest authoritative
  server. Server selection is up to the recursive resolver's software implementation,
  and different software vendors and releases employ different criteria to
chose which authoritative servers with which to communicate.</t>

<t>Knowing how recursives choose authoritative servers is a key step to better engineer the deployment of authoritative servers. <xref target="Mueller17b"/>  evaluates this with a measurement study in which they deployed seven unicast authoritative name servers in different global locations and queried these authoritative servers from more than 9,000 RIPE Atlas probes (Vantage Points&#8212;VPs) and their respective recursive resolvers.</t>

<t>In the wild,  <xref target="Mueller17b"/>  found that recursives query all available authoritative servers, regardless of latency. But the distribution of queries tend to be skewed towards authoritatives with lower latency: the lower the latency between a recursive resolver and an authoritative server, the more often the recursive will send queries to that authoritative. Our hypothesis is that this behavior is a consequence of two main criteria employed by resolvers when choosing authoritatives: performance (lower latency) and diversity of authoritatives, where a resolver checks all recursives to determine which is closer and to provide alternatives if one is unavailable.</t>

<t>For a DNS operator, this policy means that latency of all authoritatives matter, so all must be similarly capable, since all available authoritatives will be queried by most recursives. Since unicast cannot deliver good latency worldwide (a site in Europe will always have a high latency to resolvers in California, for example),  <xref target="Mueller17b"/>  recommends to DNS operators that they deploy equally strong IP anycast in every authoritative server (and thus to phase out unicast), so they can deliver similar [xxx: I don't think similar is the right word here. "good" or "best possible"? &#8211; Wes] latency values to recursives. Having one or few unicast authoritative will limit the worst-case latency for most users [xxx: I don't understand what this sentence is trying to bring up as a point but can't fix it without potentially changing the meaning in a way that wasn't intended &#8211; Wes]. Note that DNS operators should also take architectural considerations into account when planning for deploying anycast <xref target="RFC1546"/>.</t>

<t>This recommendation was deployed at the ".nl" TLD zone, which originally had a mixed unicast/anycast setup; since early 2018 it now has 4 anycast authoritative name servers.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="r2-routing-can-matter-more-than-locations" title="R2: Routing Can Matter More Than Locations">

<t>A common metric when choosing an anycast DNS provider or setting up an anycast service is the number of anycast sites, i.e., the number of global locations from which the same address is announced with BGP. Intuitively, one could think that more sites would lead to shorter response times.</t>

<t>However, this is not necessarily true. In fact,  <xref target="Schmidt17a"/>  found   that routing can matter more than the total number of locations. They analyzed the relationship between the number of anycast sites and performance of a service (latency-wise, RTT) and measured the overall performance of four DNS Root servers, namely C, F, K and L, from more than 7.9K RIPE Atlas probes.</t>

<t><xref target="Schmidt17a"/>  found  that the C-Root, a smaller anycast deployment with 8 sites, provided a very similar overall performance than that of the much larger deployments of K and L, with 33 and 144 sites respectively. We observed a median RTT between 30ms and 32ms for C, K and L roots, and 25ms for F.</t>

<t>Their recommendation for DNS operators when engineering anycast services is to not only consider the number of sites as a metric for performance.. They showed that 12 sites can provide reasonable latency, given they are globally distributed and have good local interconnectivity. However, more sites can be useful in handling DoS attacks <xref target="Mueller17b"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="r3-detailed-anycast-maps-of-catchments-requires-active-measurement" title="R3: Detailed Anycast Maps of Catchments Requires Active Measurement">

<t>An anycast service may have several dozens sites, as L-Root. Anycast leverages BGP to distribute the incoming queries to anycast sites; in theory, BGP forwards incoming queries to a nearby anycast site (in terms of BGP distance). However, usually queries are not evenly distributed across anycast sites, as in the case of L-Root <xref target="IcannHedge18"/>.</t>

<t>Adding new sites to an anycast service may change the load distribution across all sites, leading to suboptimal usage of the service or even stressing some sites while others remain underutilized. This is a scenario that operators constantly face when expanding an anycast service. Besides, when setting up a new anycast server, operators cannot directly estimate the query distribution among the sites.</t>

<t>To estimate the query loads across sites of an expanding service or a setting up a new service, operators need detailed anycast maps, i.e., to know which prefixes will be matched to each anycast site. To do that, <xref target="Vries17b"/> recommends operators carrying out active measurements, using a technique and tool we have developed called Verfploeter. Verfploeter maps the entire IPv4 space and allows DNS operators to predict both query distribution and clients catchment before deploying new anycast sites.</t>

<t><xref target="Vries17b"/> have used this technique to predict both the catchment and query load distribution for the new anycast service of B-Root. First, they set up two anycast sites Miami (MIA) and Los Angeles (LAX) which were exact copies of those sites from the operational B-Root server. Next, they sent ICMP packets to multiple IPs from each /24 in on the Internet, and used an IP within the anycast range as the source of these ICMP packets. Then, they observed to which site BGP mapped the ICMP echo replies, generating a catchment map. They  then weighted the incoming traffic of 1 day of B-Root traffic (2017-04-12, DITL datasets  <xref target="Ditl17"/>) using this catchment mapping, and estimated that 81.6% of the traffic would go to the LAX site. The actual value was 81.4% of traffic going to LAX, which means that the estimation was pretty close.</t>

<t>Besides that, Verfploeter can be used to estimate how traffic shifts among sites in case some of BGP manipulations are executed, such as AS Path prepending also used during DDoS attacks. We created a new catchment mapping for each configuration: no prepending, and prepeding with 1, 2 or 3
hops. Then, <xref target="Vries17b"/> used this mappings to estimate the load distribution for each
configuration.</t>

<t>Therefore, <xref target="Vries17b"/> recommendation for DNS operators is to make informed choices when engineering new anycast sites or expand current ones by using catchment maps with active measurements carried out with Verfploeter. Besides, operators can spot suboptimal routing situations early, with a fine granularity, and with better coverage than using traditional measurement platforms such as Ripe Atlas.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="r4-when-under-stress-two-strategies" title="R4: When under stress, two strategies">

<t>DDoS attacks are becoming bigger, cheaper, and more frequent <xref target="Mueller17b"/>. The most powerful recorded DDoS attack to DNS servers to date reached 1.2 Tbps, by using IoT devices <xref target="Perlroth16"/>. Such attacks call for an answer for the following question: how should a DNS operator engineer its anycast authoritative DNS server react to the stress of a DDoS attack? We have investigated this question in study <xref target="Moura16b"/> in which they ground empirical observations with the following theoretical evaluation of options.</t>

<t>An authoritative DNS server deployed using anycast will have many sites distributed over many networks. Ultimately, the relationship between the DNS provider network and a client's ISP will determine which anycast site will answer for queries for a given client. As a consequence, when an anycast authoritative server is under attack, the load that each anycast site receives is likely to be unevenly distributed (a function of the source of the attacks), thus some sites may be more overloaded than others which is what was observed analyzing the Root DNS events of Nov. 2015 <xref target="Moura16b"/>. Given the fact that different sites may have different capacity (bandwidth, CPU, etc.), the choice of how to react to stress becomes even more difficult.</t>

<t>In practice, an anycast site under stress, overloaded with incoming traffic, has two options:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>It can withdraw/prepend route to some or to all of its neighbors, shrinking its catchment (number of clients that BGP maps to it) and shifting both legitimate and attack traffic to other anycast sites. Possibly those sites will have greater capacity and service the queries.</t>
  <t>Alternatively, it can be become a degraded absorber, continuing to operate, but with overloaded ingress routers, dropping some incoming legitimate requests due to queue overflow. However, continued operation will also absorb traffic from attackers in its catchment, protecting other anycast sites.</t>
</list></t>

<t><xref target="Moura16b"/> saw both of these behaviors in practice in the Root DNS events and observe them through site reachability and RTTs. These options represent different uses of an anycast deployment. A withdrawal strategy causes anycast to respond as a waterbed, with stress displacing queries from one site to others. The absorption strategy behaves as a conventional mattress,  compressing under load, with queries getting delayed or dropped.</t>

<t>Although described as strategies and policies, these outcomes are the result of several factors: the combination of operator and host ISP routing policy, routing implementations withdrawing under load, the nature of the attack, and the locations of the sites and attackers. Some policies are explicit, such as the choice of local-only anycast sites, or operators removing a site for maintenance or modifying routing to manage load. However, under stress, the choices of withdrawal and absorption can also be results that emerge from a mix of explicit choices and implementation details, such as BGP timeout values.</t>

<t><xref target="Moura16b"/> speculates that more careful, explicit, and automated management of policies may provide stronger defenses to overload, an area we are currently working on. For DNS operators, that means that besides traditional filtering, two other options are available (withdraw/prepend or isolate sites), and the best choice depends on the specifics of the attack.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="r5-be-careful-on-how-to-choose-your-records-time-to-live-values" title="R5: Be careful on how to choose your records time-to-live values">

<t>In a DNS response, each resource record is accompanied by a time-to-live value, which "describes how long  a RR can be cached before it should be discarded" <xref target="RFC1034"/>. The TTL values are set by authoritative DNS server operators at their zone files &#8211; either specifically per record or as default values for the entire zone. Sometimes the same research record may have different TTL values &#8211; one from the parent and one from the child DNS server. In this cases, resolvers are expected to prioritize the answer according to Section 5.4.1 in <xref target="RFC2182"/>.</t>

<t>While set by authoritative server operators (ATs in <xref target="recuath"/>), the TTL value in fact influences the behavior of recursive resolvers (and their operators &#8211; Rn in the same figure), by setting an upper limit on how long a record should be cached before discarded.
In this sense, caching can be seen as  a sort of "ephemeral replication", i.e., the contents of an authoritative server are placed at a recursive resolver cache for a period of time up to the TTL value. Caching improves response times (by avoiding repeated queries between recursive resolvers and authoritative).</t>

<t>Besides improving performance, caching may play a significant role during DoS attacks against authoritative servers. To investigate that, we carried out a study <xref target="Moura18b"/> that evaluates the role of caching (and retries) in DNS resiliency to DDoS attacks. We configured two authoritative name servers for our newly registered domain and carried out a series of experiments with various TTL values (60,1800, 3600, 86400s) for records and sent unique DNS queries from roughly 15,000 vantage points, using Ripe Atlas.</t>

<t>We found that caching, in the wild, works as expected 70% of the times &#8211; for various TTL values we found. We believe that complex recursive infrastructure (such as anycast recursives with fragmented cache), besides cache flushing and hierarchy explains these other 30% of non cached records. We confirmed the results from our experiments by analyzing authoritative traffic for the .nl TLD, which showed similar figures.</t>

<t>We then set out to emulate DDoS attacks on authoritative servers by  dropping all incoming pakcets for various TTLs values. We found that:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>At 100% of packets dropped, the TTL value of the record set by the authoritative determined how long clients received responses, together with the status of the cache at the attack time. Given the TTL value decreases as time passes at the cache, it protected clients for up to its value in cache.</t>
  <t>Once TTL values expire, we also saw evidence of some recursives serving stale content <xref target="  I-D.ietf-dnsop-terminology-bis"/>. Serve stale was the only option when TTL values expire in recursives cache and authoritative servers were completely unavailable.</t>
</list></t>

<t>We also emulated partial-failure DDoS (similar to Dyn 2016 <xref target="Perlroth16"/>), when authoritative are partially available, by dropping packet at rates of 50-90%, for various TTL values. We found that:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>For various TTL values, caching was a key component in the success of queries. For example, for a 50% packet drop rate at the authoritatives, still most of clients got an answer.</t>
  <t>When caching could not help (for a scenario with TTL of 60s, and time in between probing of 10minutes), recursive servers kept on retrying queries to authoritatives: at 90% packet drop with TTL of 60s, we found that 27% of clients still got an answer, at the price of increased response times.</t>
  <t>We also found that these retries have a significant effect on the authoriative side: we saw a 8.1x times increase in normal traffic during a 90% packet drop with TTL of 60s, as recursives attempt to resolve queries &#8211; what we refer to "friendly fire".</t>
</list></t>

<t>Therefore, given the role of TTL, our recommendation for DNS operators is to set their TTL values carefully, knowing that they will influence (i) the success of client's queries and (ii) the amount of "friendly fire" traffic they will receive. Many operators may as well reconsider their 10x overprovision metric for DNS servers, given this significant increase legitimate traffic during DDoS.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="r6-shared-infrastructure-risks-collateral-damage-during-attacks" title="R6: Shared Infrastructure Risks Collateral Damage During Attacks">

<t>Co-locating services, such as authoritative servers, creates some degree of shared risk, in that stress on one service may spill over into another, resulting in collateral damage. Collateral damage is a common side-effect of DDoS, and data centers and operators strive to minimize collateral damage through redundancy, overcapacity, and isolation.</t>

<t>We have also seen this in practice during the DDoS attack against the Root DNS system in November 2015 <xref target="Moura16b"/>. In this study, we found that two services not directly targeted by the attack, namely D-Root and the .nl TLD, suffered collateral damage. These services showed reduced end-to-end performance (i.e., higher latency and reduced reachability) with timing consistent with the DDoS event, strongly suggesting a shared resource with original targets of the attack.</t>

<t>Another example of collateral damage was the 1.2 Tbps attack against Dyn, a major DNS provider on October 2017 <xref target="Perlroth16"/>. As a result, many of their customers, including Airbnb, HBO, Netflix, and Twitter experience issues in resolving their domains, since they partially shared the same infrastructure.</t>

<t>Our recommendation, therefore, is when choosing third-party DNS providers, operators should be aware of shared infrastructure risks. By sharing infrastructure, there is an increased attack surface.</t>
