<section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

<t>The domain name system (DNS) has main two types of DNS servers: authoritative servers and recursive resolvers. <xref target="recuath"/> shows their relationship. An authoritative server (ATn in <xref target="recuath"/>) knows the content of a DNS zone from local knowledge, and thus can answer queries about that zone  without needing to query other servers <xref target="RFC2181"/>. A recursive resolver (Re_n) is a program that extracts information from name servers in response to client requests <xref target="RFC1034"/>. A client (stub in <xref target="recuath"/>) refers to stub resolver <xref target="RFC1034"/> that is typically located within the client software.</t>

<t>DNS queries/responses contribute to user's perceived latency and affect user experience <xref target="Sigla2014"/>, and the DNS system has been subject to repeated Denial of Service (DoS) attacks (for example, in November 2015 <xref target="Moura16b"/>) in order to degrade user experience.</t>

<t>To reduce latency and improve resiliency against DoS attacks, DNS uses several types of server replication. Replication at the authoritative server level can be achieved with (i) the deployment of multiple servers for the same zone <xref target="RFC1035"/> (AT1&#8212;AT4 in <xref target="recuath"/>), (ii) the use of IP anycast <xref target="RFC1546"/><xref target="RFC4786"/><xref target="RFC7094"/> that allows the same IP address to be announced from multiple locations (each of them referred to as anycast instance <xref target="RFC8499"/>) and (iii) by using load balancers to support multiple servers inside a single (potentially anycasted) instance. As a consequence, there are many possible ways an authoritative DNS provider can engineer its production authoritative server network, with multiple viable choices and no single optimal design.</t>

<t>This document summarizes recent research work exploring DNS configurations and offers specific tangible recommendations to DNS authoritative servers operators (DNS operators hereafter).
[RF:JAb2]],  [RF:MSJ1], [RF:DW2].  The recommendations (R1&#8211;R6) presented in this document are backed by previous research work, which used wide-scale Internet measurements upon which to draw their conclusions. This document describes the key engineering options, and points readers to the pertinent papers for details.</t>

<t>[RF:JAb1, Issue#2].
These recommendations are designed for operators of "large" authoritative
servers for domains like TLDs.
"Large" authoritative servers refers to those with a significant global user population.
These recommendations may not be appropriate for smaller domains,
such as those used by an organization with users in one city or region,
where goals such as uniform low latency are less strict.</t>

<!---
This recommendations  provided here are for authoritative DNS zone owners and
server operators, as the studies cited in this publication were analyzing authoritative DNS zones and services.
#repetitive text - GMoura 20181210

<t>It is likely that these recommendations might be useful in a wider context, such as for any stateless/short-duration, anycasted service. Because the
conclusions of the studies don't verify this fact,  the wording in this document discusses DNS authoritative services only.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="r1-use-equaly-strong-ip-anycast-in-every-authoritative-server-to-achieve-even-load-distribution" title="R1:  Use equaly strong IP anycast in every authoritative server to achieve even load distribution">

<t>Authoritative DNS servers operators announce their authoritative servers as NS records<xref target="RFC1034"/>. Different authoritatives for a given zone should return the same content, typically by staying synchronized using DNS zone transfers (AXFR<xref target="RFC5936"/> and IXFR<xref target="RFC1995"/>) to coordinate the authoritative zone data to return to their clients.</t>

<t>DNS heavily relies upon replication to support high reliability,
capacity and to reduce latency <xref target="Moura16b"/>. DNS has two complementary mechanisms to replicate the service. First, the protocol itself supports nameserver replication of DNS service for
a DNS zone through the use of multiple nameservers that each operate on different IP addresses, listed by a zone's NS records. Second, each of these network addresses can run from multiple physical locations through the use of
IP anycast<xref target="RFC1546"/><xref target="RFC4786"/><xref target="RFC7094"/>, by announcing the same IP address from each instance and allowing Internet routing
(BGP<xref target="RFC4271"/>) to associate clients with their topologically nearest anycast instance. Outside the DNS protocol, replication can be achieved by deploying load balancers at each physical location.  Nameserver replication is recommended for all zones (multiple NS records), and IP anycast is used by most large zones such as the DNS Root, most top-level domains<xref target="Moura16b"/> and large commercial enterprises, governments and other organizations.</t>

<t>Most DNS operators strive to reduce latency for users of their service.
However, because they control only their authoritative servers, and not the recursive resolvers communicating with those servers, it is difficult to ensure that recursives will be served by the closest authoritative server. Server selection is up to the recursive resolver's software implementation, and different software vendors and releases employ different criteria to chose which authoritative servers with which to communicate.</t>

<t>Knowing how recursives choose authoritative servers is a key step to better engineer the deployment of authoritative servers. <xref target="Mueller17b"/>  evaluates this with a measurement study in which they deployed seven unicast authoritative name servers in different global locations and queried these authoritative servers from more than 9k RIPE Atlas probes and and their respective recursive resolvers.</t>

<t>In the wild,  <xref target="Mueller17b"/>  found that recursives query all available authoritative servers, regardless of the observed latency. But the distribution of queries tend to be skewed towards authoritatives with lower latency: the lower the latency between a recursive resolver and an authoritative server, the more often the recursive will send queries to that authoritative. These results were obtained by aggregating results from all vantage points and not specific to any vendor/version.</t>

<t>The hypothesis is that this behavior is a consequence of two main criteria employed by resolvers when choosing authoritatives: performance (lower latency) and diversity of authoritatives, where a resolver checks all authoritative servers to determine which is closer and to provide alternatives if one is unavailable.</t>

<t>For a DNS operator, this policy means that latency of all authoritatives matter, so all must be similarly capable, since all available authoritatives will be queried by most recursive resolvers. Since unicast cannot deliver good latency worldwide (a unicast authoritative server in Europe will always have high latency to resolvers in California, for example, given its geographical distance),  <xref target="Mueller17b"/>  recommends to DNS operators that they deploy equally strong IP anycast in every authoritative server (NS record), in terms of number of instances and peering, and, consequently, to phase out unicast, so they can deliver latency values to global clients. However,  <xref target="Mueller17b"/> also notes that DNS operators should also take architectural considerations into account when planning for deploying anycast <xref target="RFC1546"/>.</t>

<t>This recommendation was deployed at the ".nl" TLD zone, which originally had seven authoritative severs (mixed unicast/anycast setup). .nl has moved in early 2018 to a setup with 4 anycast authoritative name servers. This is not to say that .nl was the first &#8211; other zones, have been running anycast only authoritatives (e.g., .be since 2013). <xref target="Mueller17b"/> contribution is to show that unicast cannot deliver good latency worldwide, and that anycast has to be deployed to deliver good latency worldwide.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="r2-routing-can-matter-more-than-locations" title="R2: Routing Can Matter More Than Locations">

<t>A common metric when choosing an anycast DNS provider or setting up an anycast service is the number of anycast instances<xref target="RFC4786"/>, i.e., the number of global locations from which the same address is announced with BGP. Intuitively, one could think that more instances will lead to shorter response times.</t>

<t>However, this is not necessarily true. In fact,  <xref target="Schmidt17a"/>  found   that routing can matter more than the total number of locations. They analyzed the relationship between the number of anycast instances and the performance of a service (latency-wise, RTT) and measured the overall performance of four DNS Root servers, namely C, F, K and L, from more than 7.9k RIPE Atlas probes.</t>

<t><xref target="Schmidt17a"/>  found  that C-Root, a smaller anycast deployment consisting of only 8 instances (they refer to anycast instance as anycast site), provided a very similar overall performance than that of the much larger deployments of K and L, with 33 and 144 instances respectively. The median RTT for C, K and L Root was between 30-32ms.</t>

<t><xref target="Schmidt17a"/> recommendation for DNS operators when engineering anycast services is consider factors other than just the number of instances (such as local routing connectivity) when designing for performance. They showed that 12 instances can provide reasonable latency, given they are globally distributed and have good local interconnectivity. However, more instances can be useful for other reasons, such as when handling DDoS attacks <xref target="Moura16b"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="r3-collecting-detailed-anycast-catchment-maps-ahead-of-actual-deployment-can-improve-engineering-designs" title="R3: Collecting Detailed Anycast Catchment Maps Ahead of Actual Deployment Can Improve Engineering Designs">

<t>An anycast DNS service may have several dozens or even more than one hundred instances (such as L-Root does). Anycast leverages Internet routing to distribute the incoming queries to a service's distributed anycast instances; in theory, BGP (the Internet's defacto routing protocol) forwards incoming queries to a nearby anycast instance (in terms of BGP distance). However, usually queries are not evenly distributed across all anycast instances, as found in the case of L-Root <xref target="IcannHedge18"/>.</t>

<t>Adding new instances to an anycast service may change the load distribution across all instances, leading to suboptimal usage of the service or even stressing some instances while others remain underutilized. This is a scenario that operators constantly face when expanding an anycast service. Besides, when setting up a new anycast service instance, operators cannot directly estimate the query distribution among the instances in advance of enabling the new instance.</t>

<t>To estimate the query loads across instances of an expanding service or a when setting up an entirely new service, operators need detailed anycast maps and catchment estimates (i.e., operators need to know which prefixes will be matched to which anycast instance). To do that, <xref target="Vries17b"/> developed a new technique enabling operators to carry out active measurements, using aan open-source tool called Verfploeter (available at <xref target="VerfSrc"></xref>). Verfploeter maps a large portion of the IPv4 address space, allowing DNS operators to predict both query distribution and clients catchment before deploying new anycast instances.</t>

<t><xref target="Vries17b"/> shows how this technique was used to predict both the catchment and query load distribution for the new anycast service of B-Root. Using two anycast instances in Miami (MIA) and Los Angeles (LAX) from the operational B-Root server, they sent ICMP echo packets to IP addresses to each IPv4 /24 on the Internet using a source address within the anycast prefix. Then, they recorded which instance the ICMP echo replies arrived at based on the Internet's BGP routing.  This analysis resulted in an Internet wide catchment map. Weighting was then applied to the incoming traffic prefixes based on of 1 day of B-Root traffic (2017-04-12, DITL datasets <xref target="Ditl17"/>).  The combination of the created catchment mapping and the load per prefix created an estimate predicting that 81.6% of the traffic would go to the LAX instance. The actual value was 81.4% of traffic going to LAX, showing that the estimation was pretty close and the Verfploeter technique was a excellent method of predicting traffic loads in advance of a new anycast instance deployment (<xref target="Vries17b"/>  also uses the term anycast site to refer to anycast instance).</t>

<t>Besides that, Verfploeter can also be used to estimate how traffic shifts among instances when BGP manipulations are executed, such as AS Path prepending that is frequently used by production networks during DDoS attacks. A new catchment mapping for each prepending configuration configuration: no prepending, and prepending with 1, 2 or 3 hops at each instance. Then, <xref target="Vries17b"/> shows that this mapping can accurately estimate the load distribution for each configuration.</t>

<t>An important operational takeaway from <xref target="Vries17b"/> is that DNS operators can make informed choices when engineering new anycast instances or when expending new ones by carrying out active measurements using Verfploeter in advance of operationally enabling the fully anycast service.  Operators can spot sub-optimal routing situations early, with a fine granularity, and with significantly better coverage than using traditional measurement platforms such as RIPE Atlas.</t>

<t>To date, Verfploeter has been deployed on B-Root<xref target="Vries17b"/>, on a operational testbed (Anycast testbed) <xref target="AnyTest"/>, and on a large unnamed operator.</t>

<t>The recommendation is therefore to deploy  a small test Verfploeter-enabled platform in advance at a potential anycast instance may reveal the realizable benefits of using that instance as an anycast interest, potentially saving significant financial and labor costs of deploying hardware to a new instance that was less effective than as had been hoped.</t>

<section anchor="r4-when-under-stress-employ-two-strategies" title="R4: When under stress, employ two strategies">

<t>DDoS attacks are becoming bigger, cheaper, and more frequent <xref target="Moura16b"/>. The most powerful recorded DDoS attack to DNS servers to date reached 1.2 Tbps, by using IoT devices <xref target="Perlroth16"/>. Such attacks call for an answer for the following question: how should a DNS operator engineer its anycast authoritative DNS server react to the stress of a DDoS attack? This question is investigated in study <xref target="Moura16b"/> in which empirical observations are grounded with the following theoretical evaluation of options.</t>

<t>An authoritative DNS server deployed using anycast will have many server instances distributed over many networks and instances. Ultimately, the relationship between the DNS provider's network and a client's ISP will determine which anycast instance will answer queries for a given client. As a consequence, when an anycast authoritative server is under attack, the load that each anycast instance receives is likely to be unevenly distributed (a function of the source of the attacks), thus some instances may be more overloaded than others which is what was observed analyzing the Root DNS events of Nov. 2015 <xref target="Moura16b"/>. Given the fact that different instances may have different capacity (bandwidth, CPU, etc.), making a decision about how to react to stress becomes even more difficult.</t>

<t>In practice, an anycast instance under stress, overloaded with incoming traffic, has two options:
<!--
PREVIous text
* It can withdraw or pre-prepend its route to some or to all of its neighbors, shrinking its catchment (the number of clients that BGP maps to it), shifting both legitimate and attack traffic to other anycast instances. The other instances will hopefully have greater capacity and be able to service the queries.
--></t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>It can withdraw or pre-prepend its route to some or to all of its neighbors, ([RF:Issue3]) perform other traffic shifting tricks (such as reducing the propagation of its announcements using  BGP communities<xref target="RFC1997"/>) which shrinks portions of its catchment), use FlowSpec <xref target="RFC5575"/> or other upstream communication mechanisms to deploy upstream filtering.  The goals of these techniques is to perform some combination of shifting of both legitimate and attack traffic to other anycast instances (with hopefully greater capacity) or to block the traffic entirely.</t>
  <t>Alternatively, it can be become a degraded absorber, continuing to operate, but with overloaded ingress routers, dropping some incoming legitimate requests due to queue overflow. However, continued operation will also absorb traffic from attackers in its catchment, protecting the other anycast instances.</t>
</list></t>

<t><xref target="Moura16b"/> saw both of these behaviors in practice in the Root DNS events, observed through instance reachability and route-trip time (RTTs). These options represent different uses of an anycast deployment. The withdrawal strategy causes anycast to respond as a waterbed, with stress displacing queries from one instance to others. The absorption strategy behaves as a conventional mattress,  compressing under load, with some queries getting delayed or dropped.</t>

<t>Although described as strategies and policies, these outcomes are the result of several factors: the combination of operator and host ISP routing policies, routing implementations withdrawing under load, the nature of the attack, and the locations of the instances and the attackers. Some policies are explicit, such as the choice of local-only anycast instances, or operators removing an instance for maintenance or modifying routing to manage load. However, under stress, the choices of withdrawal and absorption can also be results that emerge from a mix of explicit choices and implementation details, such as BGP timeout values.</t>

<t><xref target="Moura16b"/> speculates that more careful, explicit, and automated management of policies may provide stronger defenses to overload, an area currently under study. For DNS operators, that means that besides traditional filtering, two other options are available (withdraw/prepend/communities or isolate instances), and the best choice depends on the specifics of the attack.</t>

<t>Note that this recommendation refers to the operation of one anycast service, i.e., one anycast NS record. However, DNS zones with multiple NS anycast services may expect load to spill from one anycast server to another,as resolvers switch from authoritative to authoritative when attempting to resolve a name <xref target="Mueller17b"/>.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="r5-consider-longer-time-to-live-values-whenever-possible" title="R5: Consider longer time-to-live values whenever possible">

<t>In a DNS response, each resource record is accompanied by a time-to-live value (TTL), which "describes how long  a RR can be cached before it should be discarded" <xref target="RFC1034"/>. The TTL values are set by zone owners in their zone files &#8211; either specifically per record or by using default values for the entire zone. Sometimes the same resource record may have different TTL values &#8211; one from the parent and one from the child DNS server. In this case, resolvers are expected to prioritize the answer according to Section 5.4.1 in <xref target="RFC2181"/>.</t>

<t>While set at authoritative servers, (ATn in <xref target="recuath"/>), the TTL value in fact influences the behavior of recursive resolvers (and their operators &#8211; "Re_n" in the same figure), by setting an upper limit on how long a record should be cached before discarded.
In this sense, caching can be seen as  a sort of "ephemeral replication", i.e., the contents of an authoritative server are placed at a recursive resolver cache for a period of time up to the TTL value. Caching improves response times by avoiding repeated queries between recursive resolvers and authoritative.</t>

<t>Besides improving performance, it has been argued that caching plays a significant role in protecting users during DDoS attacks against authoritative servers.  To investigate that, <xref target="Moura18b"/> evaluates the role of caching (and retries) in DNS resiliency to DDoS attacks. Two authoritative servers were configured for a newly registered domain and a series of experiments were carried out using various TTL values (60,1800, 3600, 86400s) for records.  Unique DNS queries were sent from roughly 15,000 vantage points, using RIPE Atlas.</t>

<t><xref target="Moura18b"/> found that, under normal operations, caching works as expected 70% of the times in the wild.  It is believed that complex recursive infrastructure (such as anycast recursives with fragmented cache), besides cache flushing and hierarchy explains these other 30% of the non-cached records. The results from the experiments were confirmed by analyzing authoritative traffic for the .nl TLD, which showed similar figures.</t>

<t><xref target="Moura18b"/> also emulated DDoS attacks on authoritative servers by dropping all incoming packets for various TTLs values. For experiments when all authoritative servers were completely unreachable, they found that the TTL value on the DNS records determined how long clients received responses, together with the status of the cache at the attack time.  Given the TTL value decreases as time passes at the cache, it protected clients for up to its value in cache.
Once the TTL expires,  there was some evidence of some recursives serving stale content <xref target="I-D.ietf-dnsop-serve-stale"/>. Serving stale is the only viable option when TTL values expire in recursive caches and authoritative servers became completely unavailable.</t>

<t>They also emulated  partial-failure DDoS, i.e., DDoS that cause authoritative to respond to be able to respond part of the queries (similar to Dyn 2016 <xref target="Perlroth16"/>). They emulate such scenario by dropping incoming packet at rates of 50&#8211;90%, for various TTL values. They found that:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>Caching was a key component in the success of queries. For example, with a 50% packet drop rate at the authoritatives,  most clients eventually got an answer.</t>
  <t>Recursives retries was also a key part of resilience: when caching could not help (for a scenario with TTL of 60s, and time in between probing of 10 minutes), recursive servers kept retrying queries to authoritatives. With 90% packet drop on both authoritatives (with TTL of 60s), 27% of clients still got an answer due to retries, at the price of increased response times. However, this came with a price for authroritative servers: a 8.1 times increase in normal traffic during a 90% packet drop with TTL of 60s, as recursives attempt to resolve queries &#8211; thus effectively creating "friendly fire".</t>
</list></t>

<t>Altogether, these results help to explain why previous attacks against the Roots were not noticed by most users <xref target="Moura18b"/> and why other attacks (such as Dyn 2016 <xref target="Perlroth16"/>) had significant impact on users experience: records on the Root zone have TTL values ranging from 1 to 6 days, while some of unreachable Dyn clients had TTL values ranging from 120 to 300s, which limit how long records ought to be cached.</t>

<t>Therefore, given the important role of the TTL on user's experience during a DDoS attack (and in reducing ''friendly fire''), it is recommended that DNS zone owners set their TTL values carefully, using reasonable TTL values (at least 1 hour) whenever possible, given its role in DNS resilience against DDoS attacks.
However, the choice of the value depends on the specifics of each operator (CDNs are known for using TTL values in the range of few minutes).
The drawback of setting larger TTL values is that changes on the authoritative system infrastructure (e.g.: adding a new authoritative server or changing IP address) will take at least as long as the TTL to propagate among clients.</t>

<section anchor="r6-shared-infrastructure-risks-collateral-damage-during-attacks" title="R6: Shared Infrastructure Risks Collateral Damage During Attacks">

<t>Co-locating services, such as authoritative servers, creates some degree of shared risk, in that stress on one service may spill over into another, resulting in collateral damage. Collateral damage is a common side-effect of DDoS, and data centers and operators strive to minimize collateral damage through redundancy, overcapacity, and isolation.</t>

<t>This has been seen in practice during the DDoS attack against the Root DNS system in November 2015 <xref target="Moura16b"/>. In this study, it was shown that two services not directly targeted by the attack, namely D-Root and the .nl TLD, suffered collateral damage. These services showed reduced end-to-end performance (i.e., higher latency and reduced reachability) with timing consistent with the DDoS event, strongly suggesting a shared resource with original targets of the attack.</t>

<t>Another example of collateral damage was the 1.2 Tbps attack against Dyn, a major DNS provider on October 2017 <xref target="Perlroth16"/>. As a result, many of their customers, including Airbnb, HBO, Netflix, and Twitter experienced issues with clients failing to resolve their domains, since the servers partially shared the same infrastructure.</t>

<t>It is recommended, therefore, when choosing third-party DNS providers, operators should be aware of shared infrastructure risks. By sharing infrastructure, there is an increased attack surface.</t>
